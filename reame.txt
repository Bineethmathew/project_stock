Purpose
This program aims to analyze, visualize, and predict stock prices using advanced machine learning models. It focuses on stock data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and implementing predictive models like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). Predictions are made for Tesla (TSLA) and JP Morgan (JPM) stocks.

Methods Used

Data Collection

Stock data is fetched using the yfinance library for Tesla and JP Morgan.
Data includes fields like Open, Close, High, Low, and Volume.
Data Preprocessing

Cleaned missing values and outliers using z-score methods.
Applied MinMaxScaler for normalization, crucial for LSTM and GRU models.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized trends, volatility, and anomalies in stock prices.
Used logarithmic transformations and rolling windows for trend analysis.
Time-Series Modeling

Created lag-based sequences using TimeseriesGenerator.
Implemented three deep learning models:
RNN: Captures sequential dependencies.
LSTM: Specialized for long-term dependencies.
GRU: Efficient alternative to LSTM.
Trained models using historical data, validated with Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Prediction and Visualization

Generated stock price predictions for the next 30 days for Tesla and JP Morgan.
Visualized historical vs. predicted prices, highlighting short-term trends.
